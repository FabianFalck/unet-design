# Scenario: You are a beginner to PDE surrogate modeling

PDE surrogate modeling has seen quite some interest being at the intersection of AI and Science.
You probably have read an exciting PDE surrogate modeling paper (more frequently termed operator learning paper), and maybe you want to understand how the pipeline works. PDEArena can be a perfect place for you to start learning about _standardized_ PDE surrogate implementations and evaluations, following modern deep learning best practices.
